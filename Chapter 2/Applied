    a) Flexible better than flexible because of high number of data points.
    b) Inflexible better than Flexible because of high number of predictors.
    c) Flexible better than Inflexible because of non-linearity.
    d) Inflexible better than Flexible because of high-variance.

    b) Classification -- Prediction -- n=20, p=13
    c) Regression -- Prediction -- n=52, p=3

Bias Variance Tradeoff:
    Variance - The amount f-hat would change when trained over a different dataset i.e. the change in the predictions when the predictors values change.
    Bias - Error introduced by approximating a real life complex problem using a simpler model.

    a) Classification :
        Loan Default - Both Inference & Prediction
        Churn - Both Inference & Prediction
        Image classification - Prediction
    b) Regression :
        TV Ratings - Inference
        Sales - Both Inference & Prediction
        Co2 Emissions - Inference
    c) Clustering :
        High- Low Value Fan Segmentation
        Similar Customer Segments
        House Segmentation

Flexible vs Non-Flexible

Flexible method advantages:
    Decreased bias (less assumptions about the functional form of f^)
    Capture non-linear relationships
    Capture complex variable interactions
    Often require less assumptions
    Often outperform less flexible methods in prediction error

Flexible method disadvantages:
    Increased variance (easier to over-fit)
    Require tuning
    Increased training times (cross-validation or equivalent is basically necessary to mitigate high variance & tune hyperparameters)
    Require more variables and observations to work optimally
    Less interpretable

More flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach due to:
    When the primary concern is predictive power
    When there is sufficient computing power for variance-controlling measures (e.g. cross-validation)
    When there is a large number of variables
    When non-linear or interaction relationships are present
    When there is a large amount of data

When might a less flexible approach be preferred?
    When we are more interested in interpretability/inference
    When we suspect that the assumptions of the less flexible method are satisfied (e.g. relationships appear linear, some variables are certainly useless -> LASSO linear regression may perform better than anything else)
    When clarification behind why an observation has a particular prediction may be necessary

KNN
    b) Green (nearest is 1.414)
    c) Red ( G - 1.414, R - 1.732 & 2)
    d) If K increases, flexibility decreases. So to capture the non-linear relationship we need more flexibility and smaller K.
